The stars truly aligned in my journey to start my coding adventure. 

I've always been curious and interested in coding but never fully dove into it due to my own fears. The contstant thoughts ran through my head... 

*it's to late to learn...*
*it's too difficult...*
*I don't have any programming background...*
*you won't be able to succeed in this industry...*


My very first experience in coding was back in high school over 15 year ago, during the good old days of dial-up internet and "You got mail!". I didn't even know that I was "coding" when I was making my own custom pages using HTML codes on my Geocities homepage. It was an exiciting time for me, I would spend hours changing and adding new things to my homepage. I felt as though I was able to carve out my own space in the universe of the world wide web. It my creative outlet a place to create things like an artist would paint a picture. I would scour the internet to find any information and tips to create my own masterpiece. My homepage had music, sparkly cursors, blinking colored texts and animated gifs.  

Unfortunately, a lot of things in that era didn't last. 

*Geocities... Friendster... Xanga...*

And like *POOF* it was gone... it disappeared... 

I never thought about coding again until a few months ago. I started doing free JavaScript tuorials on codeacademy and freecodecamp and I starting listening to CodeNewbie podcast. The tutorials were actually pretty fun.. trying to figure out how to code and make things work. I would do this after my regular 9-5 job at deisgn firm doing consumer product development.

And somehow I came across a scholarship to Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program in partnership with Women Who Code! I honestly felt really under qualified to even apply. But to my amazement I was offered the partial scholarship which really catapulted my decision to give learning to coding my 100% effort. I quit my job that I had for 7 years to embark on this journey to a new career path. I felt overwhelmed, excited, anxious, happy, and scared. I mean I still feel that way but I know that if I didn't try now that I would regret this opporunity.

So here I am, into my 3rd week of coding full-time... It's been fun and challenging and I can't wait to learn more!
